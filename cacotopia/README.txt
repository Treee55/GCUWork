This is a C++ console based video game. this game enables players to run through a gladiator style
fighting game. It was made to showcase OOP. Since it has been developed further, giving it a plot,
save functions, and replay ability. While it has no GUI it is an interesting game to build.

The .sln was added. This is easier to click and play instead of moving all header files.
