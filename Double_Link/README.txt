Double linked list

This is sample code of learning doubling linked lists. We are taking in values from a text file. 
Then breaking these values into nodes of a doubly linked list. Once that is completed we are putting
all values into alphabetical order and printing back to user. Play with it. Put in different values
for the txt file.
